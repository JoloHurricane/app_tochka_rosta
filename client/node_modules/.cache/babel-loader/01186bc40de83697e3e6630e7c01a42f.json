Do you know what a MERN Stack is? Do you know when you will need a MERN Stack? In this tutorial, I\\u2019m going to teach you how to create a simple MERN Stack Application. First of all, a MERN Stack is a combination of four technologies: Mongo DB, Express JS, React JS, and Node JS. OK Sam, I\\u2019d like to learn how to create my first MERN, but\\u2026 what does it means? Don\\u2019t worry, I can explain. You\\u2019re facing one of the most relevant Stacks of the world growing fast every day, acquiring many developers around the globe in a huge community. The main thing you should know is that, with MERN Stack, you\\u2019ll work with Javascript. Told this, let me explain what means each letter of this acronym. Mongo DB: A document-based open-source database, that provides you scalability and flexibility. Express JS: A structured base designed to develop web applications and APIs. React JS: A Javascript Front-end library for building user interfaces. Maintained by Facebook. Node JS: A javascript runtime built on Chrome\\u2019s V8 JS engine. Maybe you heard about another acronym very similar to MERN, called MEAN, there is, it\\u2019s almost the same, but the difference is that we use Angular instead of React. So, I believe the best way to learn everything is by doing a practical example, that means for our case we\\u2019re going to create a cinema\\u2019s movies CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) form.\"\n      }, void 0, false, {\n        fileName: _jsxFileName,\n        lineNumber: 14,\n        columnNumber: 13\n      }, this)]\n    }, void 0, true, {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 9,\n      columnNumber: 9\n    }, this)\n  }, void 0, false);\n}\n\n_c = ArticleContent;\nexport default ArticleContent;\n\nvar _c;\n\n$RefreshReg$(_c, \"ArticleContent\");","map":{"version":3,"sources":["C:/react projects/reactExpress/client/src/Pages/ArticleContent.js"],"names":["React","ArticleContent","props"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAP,MAAkB,OAAlB;;;;AAIA,SAASC,cAAT,CAAwBC,KAAxB,EAA+B;AAE3B,sBACI;AAAA,2BACA;AAAK,MAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAf;AAAA,8BACI;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cADJ,eAEI;AAAK,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,uBAAf;AAAA,+BACI;AAAK,UAAA,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAf;AAAgC,UAAA,GAAG,EAAC,kKAApC;AAAuM,UAAA,GAAG,EAAC;AAA3M;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cAFJ,eAKI;AAAG,QAAA,SAAS,EAAC,WAAb;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA,cALJ;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AAAA;AADA,mBADJ;AA+BH;;KAjCQD,c;AAmCT,eAAeA,cAAf","sourcesContent":["import React from \"react\";\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfunction ArticleContent(props) {\r\n\r\n    return(\r\n        <>\r\n        <div className=\"container\">\r\n            <h2>Title</h2>\r\n            <div className=\"img-article hoverable\">\r\n                <img className=\"responsive-img\" src=\"https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1606297158300-5c4f6d171be9?ixid=MXwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHw%3D&ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1050&q=80\" alt=\"img\"/>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <p className=\"flow-text\">Hi guys,\r\n\r\nDo you know how to create a MERN Stack?
